    <p>Hi, welcome to my small piece of the internet.</p>
    <p>I'm a software engineer and in my current role I'm hands-on with all aspects of the software development cycle.</p>
    <p>I have worked exclusivley at start-ups because I enjoy the fast pace and the ability learn new technologies.</p>

    <p>In my free time I like to learn new languages, frameworks, or just trying out ideas I have. My personal projects can be <a href="https://github.com/tythompson213">found here.</a></p>
